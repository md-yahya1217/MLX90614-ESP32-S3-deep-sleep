# MLX90614-ESP32-S3-deep-sleep
This project demonstrates how to interface the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor with an ESP32-S3 and implement an ultra-low-power mode by putting both the sensor and the microcontroller into deep sleep.  It is ideal for battery-powered or wearable IoT applications where periodic temperature readings are required with maximum power efficiency.
